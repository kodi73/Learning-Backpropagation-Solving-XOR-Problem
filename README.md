# Simple Neural Network for XOR Problem

## Project Description

This project implements a basic two-layer neural network using NumPy to solve the XOR problem. The XOR problem is a classic benchmark in neural networks because it is not linearly separable, requiring a hidden layer to be solved effectively. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the error between the network's output and the expected output for the XOR logic gate.

## Setup

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the error during training.

You can install them using pip:
